            I enjoy building projects independently â€” from concept to execution. I
            like taking on challenges that involve both hardware and software,
            allowing me to learn hands-on across the entire stack.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            I recently built a workout tracking app using SwiftUI, which helped me
            sharpen my skills in UI/UX design and front-end development for mobile
            platforms.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            Currently, I&apos;m working on a custom desk shelf project that blends 3D
            printing, PCB design, and electronics. It&apos;s a perfect example of how I
            enjoy combining creativity, engineering, and practical problem-solving
            to build things that are both functional and uniquely mine.
